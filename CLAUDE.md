# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current repository state

A minimal implementation skeleton exists and is covered by unit tests. Key files:

- `main.py` — CLI entry point.
- `agent/` — Core modules: config, LLM client, orchestrator, state machine, perception, security, kill switch, tools, memory, reflection, skills (AutoSkill learning).
- `eventbus/` — Asyncio EventBus and event dataclasses.
- `mcp_client/` — Multi-server stdio MCP client.
- `ui_detector/` — GUI-Actor-3B model wrapper and verifier.
- `skills/` — `SKILL.md` skill library.
- `tests/` — pytest unit tests.
- `agent/snapshot_parser.py` — Parse Windows-MCP / Playwright accessibility snapshots into `UIElement` trees.
- `agent/logging_config.py` — Structured logging to console + rotating files.
- `setup.py` — First-run setup (venv, deps, optional weight download, smoke tests).
- `requirements-dev.txt` — pytest dev dependencies.

Design documents live under `docs/designs/` (currently untracked). The authoritative technical spec is `docs/designs/desktop_agent_v8.agent.final.md`.

## Project overview

**Caelum-Agent** is a personal Windows CLI desktop-operation agent. Users give natural-language instructions and the agent autonomously controls the browser and Windows desktop applications.

- Platform: Windows 10/11
- Form: CLI-only (no GUI, no CI/CD, no packaging, no auto-updates in the initial version)
- License: BSD 3-Clause, Copyright (c) 2026 LiaoZiqi-GZFLS

## Intended tech stack

The v8 design doc specifies the following stack:

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| LLM brain | Kimi K2.6 API (`kimi-k2.6`, base URL `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`) |
| Browser control | Playwright MCP (`npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`) |
| Desktop control | Windows-MCP (`windows-mcp serve`, official CursorTouch package) |
| Filesystem control | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` (`npx -y ... <allowed-dir>`) |
| UI detection | GUI-Actor-3B + Verifier (Microsoft, NeurIPS'25) via Transformers native inference |
| OCR | RapidOCR (ONNXRuntime, CPU) |
| Screenshots | mss + Pillow compression/cropping |
| Local memory | Kimi memory tool + local SQLite backup |
| Reflection | Kimi rethink tool + local records |
| State machine | Custom 8-state FSM |
| Event bus | Custom asyncio EventBus |
| MCP multiplexing | `mcp` Python SDK `stdio_client`, 3 concurrent stdio connections in one asyncio loop |
| Kill switch | pynput global keyboard listener + asyncio task cancellation |

Important environment constraint: GUI-Actor-3B requires Python `>=3.10,<3.13` per its `pyproject.toml`, and `windows-mcp` v0.8.2 requires Python `>=3.12`. Use **Python 3.12** for the project virtual environment so both constraints are satisfied. Do not use Python 3.13+ for the environment that loads the model.

Important model constraint: GUI-Actor-3B uses a custom architecture (`Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGenerationWithPointer`) and cannot be loaded through Ollama, GGUF, vLLM, or llama.cpp. It must be run via Transformers native inference.

```

## Configuration

Run `python setup.py` to create `config.yaml` from the example and optionally inject your Kimi API key interactively. `config.yaml` is gitignored; never commit secrets.

```powershell
python setup.py
```

For non-interactive installs, pass the key directly:

```powershell
python setup.py --api-key sk-...
```

To skip smoke tests (useful for CI or headless environments):

```powershell
python setup.py --skip-smoke-tests
```

Key sections in `config.yaml`:
- `llm`: Kimi API key, model (`kimi-k2.6`), optional `reasoning_effort`, and which Formula tools to register.
  - Do **not** set `reasoning_effort="none"` for `kimi-k2.6`; omit it or use `minimal/low/medium/high`.
  - `moonshot/code-runner:latest` (hyphen) is the correct URI and is available; the registered tool name is `code_runner` (underscore). The local `RestrictedCodeRunner` remains the default code execution backend; enable the Formula `code-runner` as an alternative if you prefer Kimi-side execution.
  - `enable_file_extract` / `enable_media_upload`: toggle the ReadDocument / ViewMedia tools (both default true).
- `mcp_servers`: commands and arguments for Playwright, Windows, and filesystem MCP servers.
- `ui_detector`: GUI-Actor-3B model path, device, dtype, verifier settings.
- `screenshot`: resolution, compression, and cropping strategy.
- `security`: auto-execute, confirm, and destructive-operation approval levels.

## Local function tools

Beyond MCP tools, the orchestrator registers these local tools on the LLM client (`agent/`):

| Tool | Module | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `CodeRunner` | `tools.py` | Sandboxed local Python; JavaScript only with `--yes`/`--yes-all` |
| `DesktopInteract` | `orchestrator.py` | Vision-based interaction for any app: preferred call is `target=<short visual description>` — the LLM-written query is handed to GUI-Actor pointing (top-k candidates), the verifier re-ranks, and the best candidate executes immediately; ties (same verdict, scores within `AMBIGUITY_SCORE_MARGIN=0.1`) return `[ambiguous]` + annotated screenshot for `label=` disambiguation |
| `PreviewPoints` | `orchestrator.py` + `preview_points.py` | Last-resort locator: 1-3 guessed coordinates (screenshot space) drawn as numbered markers on a clean screenshot copy and shown back to the model, which adjusts then clicks via `windows__Click(loc=...)`; replace semantics per call |
| `UpgradeVision` | `orchestrator.py` + `perception.py` | Raise screenshot cap from 720p to 1080p (`screenshot.upgraded_max_*`) for the rest of the task when the model can't read small text; injects a fresh 1080p perception immediately; reset per task |
| `CompleteTask` | `orchestrator.py` | Model-decided fast path: finish without verification |
| `RequestHumanHelp` | `orchestrator.py` + `choice_menu.py` | Interactive TTY question with selectable options |
| `UpdateTaskList` | `task_list.py` | Model-managed pending/in_progress/completed task list; self-clears when done |
| `ReadDocument` | `file_reader.py` | Binary docs (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/EPUB/XLSX) via Kimi Files API `file-extract`, paginated, sha256-cached; returns a `doc:<sha8>` ref |
| `DraftContent` | `content_writer.py` | Writer subagent for long-form content (persona + Partial Mode prefill), writes `data/cache/drafts/*.md`; accepts a `doc_ref` to write from a document without loading it into main context |
| `ViewMedia` | `media.py` | Local images/videos uploaded with `purpose=image`/`video` and rendered natively via `ms://` refs. Images >4K downscaled to 3840x2160; videos re-encoded to 15fps/1080p (ffmpeg from PATH, falling back to the bundled `imageio-ffmpeg` binary); source files >300MB rejected up front, 100MB cap after compression |
| `SelfWindow` | `self_window.py` | Hide/show/minimize/status for the agent's OWN console window (`GetConsoleWindow` + `ShowWindow`) so it stays out of screenshots and the UIA tree during desktop operation; auto-restored at task end, before RequestHumanHelp, and via atexit |
| `FocusGuard` | `focus_guard.py` | In-process asyncio watchdog (no subprocess) that pins the foreground to a target window, polling ~0.4s and re-focusing on drift via the AttachThreadInput recipe (plain `SetForegroundWindow` is blocked when a fullscreen game holds focus — see `scripts/spike_focus_guard.py`); stopped automatically at task end |
| `GenerateImage` | `image_gen.py` | Image-generation subagent: LLM writes SVG → CairoSVG renders PNG → uploaded for LLM visual self-review against the requirement → revises with feedback, max 5 rounds; returns `data/cache/generated/*.png` path (registered only when media upload is enabled; CairoSVG needs the native cairo library) |
| `CaptureWindow` | `window_capture.py` | Capture a window by title via `PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)` and show it to the model — works for occluded windows, Qt/DirectComposition apps with no UIA tree, and display-affinity filtered windows that mss misses (registered only when media upload is enabled) |

Kimi Files API notes: uploaded files are kept by the platform **indefinitely** (no TTL; 1000-file/10GB quota). `file-extract` uploads are deleted right after extraction (best-effort) and cached locally by sha256; `image`/`video` uploads must outlive the task that references them. All three purposes are swept at startup **and** after each task ends (fire-and-forget, never raises).

History archive: every `run_task` writes an append-only flight-recorder file `data/archives/<timestamp>-<taskid>.jsonl` (metadata line + sanitized messages; base64 screenshots stripped, sensitive tool args redacted). It is never read back by the agent — post-hoc review only.

## Development commands

Run the agent (after `python setup.py` and editing `config.yaml`):

```powershell
python main.py
```

Quick syntax/import check using the project venv:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile agent/*.py eventbus/*.py mcp_client/*.py main.py setup.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import agent; import mcp_client; import eventbus; import main; import setup"
```

Run the test suite (parallel via pytest-xdist, coverage on by default):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/ -q
```

Useful variants: `-n0` runs serially (required for pdb/breakpoint); `-m "not smoke"` skips the real API/MCP smoke tests in `tests/test_integration.py` (~45s of the suite); `--no-cov` skips coverage measurement.

Run first-time setup:

```powershell
python setup.py
```

## Planned commands

These commands are documented in the v8 spec.

### First-time setup

```powershell
python setup.py
```

The setup script is intended to:
1. Check Python 3.12 (GUI-Actor requires Python `<3.13`; `windows-mcp` requires `>=3.12`)
2. Create `.venv/` (prefer `uv`, fall back to stdlib `venv`)
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (with `--ignore-requires-python` for `windows-mcp`)
4. Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` if missing
5. Create `data/` and SQLite schema
6. Optionally download GUI-Actor-3B weights (`--download-weights --weights-source github|huggingface`)
7. Install Playwright Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium`)
8. Run smoke tests (Kimi API, all MCP servers, GUI-Actor load)

For Playwright Chromium download behind the Chinese firewall:

```powershell
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST = "https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/playwright"
python setup.py
```

To download weights from the GitHub Release mirror (recommended for China):

```powershell
python setup.py --download-weights --weights-source github
```

To download weights from HuggingFace via `hf-mirror.com`:

```powershell
python setup.py --download-weights --weights-source huggingface
```

The GitHub Release mirror is maintained at `LiaoZiqi-GZFLS/GUI-Actor-3B-Weights`. Weights are split into 1.9GB volumes because GitHub limits single release assets to 2GB.

### Running the agent

```powershell
python main.py
```

One-shot (non-interactive) mode:

```powershell
python main.py --task "open notepad" --yes
```

In `--task` mode the confirmation callback denies the action (with a warning)
when stdin is not a TTY instead of blocking on `input()`. Pass `--yes`/`-y` to
auto-approve `write_risky` actions, or `--yes-all` to also auto-approve
destructive actions (implies `--yes`; use with caution). `--yes` does not cover
destructive actions on its own.

At startup `main()` calls `agent.set_interactive(sys.stdin.isatty())`. The
system prompt then tells the model either that a human is at the keyboard (so
`RequestHumanHelp` is worth calling) or that the run is non-interactive (so it
must not call `RequestHumanHelp` and should finish with manual instructions
when blocked).

### GUI-Actor-3B weight download

```powershell
huggingface-cli download microsoft/GUI-Actor-3B-Qwen2.5-VL --local-dir ./models/gui-actor-3b
```

## Core architecture

### ReAct loop

The agent runs a five-stage loop:

```
Perceive → Reflect (on failure/unknown UI only) → Think → Act → Verify
```

Reflect is skipped on the normal path to save tokens.

### Perception fusion

```

```

Vision (GUI-Actor SoM) is lazy by default — it runs only for `DesktopInteract`. As an automatic compensation (`ui_detector.auto_compensate`, default true), `perceive()` also runs one vision pass when the UI tree comes back empty but OCR found text (UIA-less apps such as WeChat/Qt/Electron), so the model gets clickable SoM markers without having to discover `DesktopInteract` itself.

GUI-Actor runs in **instruction-conditioned pointing mode**, not full-screen detection: one inference returns top-k (default 3, `ui_detector.topk`) candidate points for the given query; the verifier crops 224×224 around each, re-scores with the same model (pass ≥0.55 / reject ≤0.25 / uncertain), and rejects are dropped from the annotations. The query is the `DesktopInteract(target=...)` description when provided, else the whole task instruction (auto-compensation fallback).

Coordinate contract: the model only ever sees the **compressed** screenshot (720p, or 1080p after `UpgradeVision`) and is told by the perception description to give `loc` coordinates in that image's space. The orchestrator rescales them to native screen pixels at execution time (`_rescale_loc_args`, using `Perception.screen_width/height` vs `screenshot_width/height`) — the model never does scaling math. Skipped when `screenshot.crop_to_active_window` is on (image is then window-relative).

### MCP server concurrency

Three MCP servers run as separate stdio processes managed in a single asyncio event loop. Corrected package names after spike verification:

| Server | Launch command |
|--------|----------------|
| Playwright MCP | `npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest` |
| Windows MCP | `windows-mcp serve` (official `windows-mcp` package; `uvx windows-mcp serve` also works) |
| Filesystem MCP | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest <allowed-dir>` |

Each connection reconnects with exponential backoff on disconnect.

**Note:** The v8 design doc used outdated/incorrect package names (`@anthropic/playwright-mcp-server`, `python -m windows_mcp_server`, `filesystem-mcp`). Always use the corrected commands above.

#### Playwright MCP usage

- Default stdio launch exposes 23 core tools. Key tools: `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_fill_form`, `browser_evaluate`, `browser_wait_for`, `browser_take_screenshot`, and `browser_snapshot`.
- `browser_snapshot` returns a **YAML accessibility tree** with element refs like `[target=e3]`. Pass those refs back to interaction tools in the `target` parameter.
- Optional capabilities (vision, storage, network, testing, devtools, PDF, config) expose extra tools such as `browser_screenshot`, cookie/storage tools, `browser_route`, etc. Enable them with the server’s `--vision` / `--capabilities` flags if needed.

#### Windows-MCP usage

- The official package exposes 19 tools: `Snapshot`, `Screenshot`, `Click`, `Type`, `Scroll`, `Move`, `Shortcut`, `Wait`, `WaitFor`, `App`, `PowerShell`, `FileSystem`, `Process`, `Scrape`, `Clipboard`, `Notification`, `Registry`, `MultiSelect`, `MultiEdit`.
- Use `Snapshot` when you need element `label` IDs for `Click`/`Type`/`Scroll`/`Move`. Use `Screenshot` for a fast visual-only capture.
- `Snapshot` supports `use_ui_tree`, `use_vision`, `use_dom`, and `use_annotation`. Browser DOM mode (`use_dom=True`) filters browser chrome and works in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. Note: `use_vision=True` only embeds the screenshot image (cursor highlight, optional grid) in the response — windows-mcp 0.8.2 has **no** vision-based element detection (no OmniParser); vision grounding is our own GUI-Actor/SoM path.
- For safety, consider excluding `PowerShell` and `Registry` via `--exclude-tools "PowerShell,Registry"` unless the task explicitly requires them.
- windows-mcp 0.8.2 has an upstream bug (`UnboundLocalError: tree_node` in `tree/service.py` when an interactive element has an empty name) that drops a window's subtree and floods stderr. `setup.py` applies an idempotent patch to the installed file after dependency installation (skipped if already fixed or the layout changed); label-expiry and stale-snapshot defenses live in `agent/tools.py` / `agent/orchestrator.py`. Root-cause writeup: `docs/windows_mcp/upstream-tree-node-issue.md`.

### Concurrency model

- Main loop: asyncio
- Visual inference thread pool: max 2 workers (GUI-Actor-3B)
- IO thread pool: max 8 workers (screenshots, file IO, MCP I/O)
- Kimi API calls: asyncio-native via httpx

### State machine

States: `IDLE → PLANNING → EXECUTING → VERIFYING → (WAITING_HUMAN →) REFLECT → COMPLETED/ERROR/STUCK`.

### Security levels

| Level | Policy | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Read | Auto | file read, A11y tree |
| Write-safe | Auto + audit | screenshot cache, temp files |
| Write-risky | Confirm | file modify, config change |
| Destructive | Mandatory human approval | data deletion, permission change |

### Kill switch

- `Ctrl+C`: cancel current operation, return to IDLE
- `/stop`: abort current task
- `/quit`: graceful exit

Auto circuit breaker: pause and switch to local mode after 5 consecutive API failures; ask for guidance after 3 consecutive action failures; re-plan after 3 loops on the same UI.

## Data storage

Planned SQLite tables: `user_preferences`, `reflections`, `skills`, `audit_log`, `state_persistence`. ChromaDB for vector search.

### AutoSkill learning

`agent/skills.py` (`SkillLearner`) generates new `SKILL.md` files from successful task trajectories. After each completed task, the orchestrator calls `SkillLearner.learn(task, action_traces)`. The learner searches existing skills by vector similarity; if the best match exceeds the configured cosine-similarity threshold (default 0.85), it merges the new trace and bumps the patch version. Otherwise it creates a new skill under `skills/learned/<name>.md`. LLM generation is used when a client is available; a deterministic template is used as fallback. `MemoryStore.sync_skills()` recursively indexes all `**/*.md` files under `skills/`.

## Key configuration

The user-editable config is `config.yaml` (gitignored). `config.py` validates it with Pydantic.

## Important design decisions

- No Ollama: the only local model is GUI-Actor-3B, loaded directly via Transformers.
- Browser automation uses the accessibility tree first (Playwright MCP), not pure vision.
- Desktop automation uses UIA/A11y first (Windows-MCP), falling back to coordinate/image methods only when needed.
- Kimi's built-in tools (`web-search`, `memory`, `rethink`, `fetch`, `excel`, `convert`, `date`, `base64`, `quickjs`, `random-choice`, `mew`) replace local implementations for search, memory, reflection, fetch, Excel/CSV analysis, and light code execution.
- `moonshot/code-runner:latest` (hyphen) is the correct URI and is available; the registered tool name is `code_runner` (underscore). For code execution, the agent uses a custom `RestrictedCodeRunner` function tool exposed via OpenAI-style Function Calling, running user/model-generated Python inside a local sandbox (subprocess + AST validation + import whitelist). The Formula `code-runner` can be enabled as an alternative. This is more flexible and safer than relying solely on a Formula tool.
- Skills are stored as `SKILL.md` files compatible with the OpenClaw/Claude Code skill format.
